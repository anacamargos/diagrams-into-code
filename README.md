# How Diagrams Translate Into Code

Visualizing our code in diagrams can be a great framework to think while modeling the design of our systems. The early visualization of the design can make an excellent tool for communicating ideas to our colleagues and planning/coordinating a team effort. Diagrams can also help with independent development, as the team can quickly plan new features design (5-10 minutes on a whiteboard), build them in parallel and later integrate the pieces without conflicting with the work of other developers.

Moreover, diagrams serve as a great diagnostic tool as they embody the dependency graph of components and modules, revealing tight coupling and even retain cycles that could potentially lead to rigidity and memory leaks.
